# Markdown Math

A simple utility to convert Markdown flavored with LaTeX $$ into image equations.
Note that this overwrites the original file.
Only equations on their own line will work for now.

As an example, consider the following line in your README

    $i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi(\mathbf{r},t) = \left [ \frac{-\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 + V(\mathbf{r},t)\right ] \Psi(\mathbf{r},t)$

would be render like this:

$i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi(\mathbf{r},t) = \left [ \frac{-\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 + V(\mathbf{r},t)\right ] \Psi(\mathbf{r},t)$
